# Coding Instructions

This project is about converting a TTS model into a BitNet TTS model, so that it can be deployed on low power devices.

while working on this project

1. Always prefer `uv add` over `pip install`
2. Always prefer `uv run` over `python`
3. Never write comments in the code
4. Always use the `test_audio.py` script to test the audio output to see if the audio file is correctly generated.

# Gemini Instructions

Fast Apply: IMPORTANT: Use `edit_file` over `str_replace` or full file writes. It works with partial code snippets—no need for full file content.

Warp Grep: warp-grep is a subagent that takes in a search string and tries to find relevant context. Best practice is to use it at the beginning of codebase explorations to fast track finding relevant files/lines. Do not use it to pin point keywords, but use it for broader semantic queries. "Find the XYZ flow", "How does XYZ work", "Where is XYZ handled?", "Where is <error message> coming from?"
